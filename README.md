## About

uze is bundeled into multiple sub-packages, such as `math`, `string` or `object`.  `uze.string` contains functions for strings, and that's the theme for all the other packages.

## Usage

Install via npm `npm install --save uze`

```javascript
const uze = require("uze");

console.log(uze.math.toHex(21))
```
